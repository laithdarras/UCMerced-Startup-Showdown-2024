# Big Bytes â€“ Startup Showdown Project

## What is this project?
Big Bytes was created for **Startup Showdown**, a weeklong competition hosted by the **UC Merced Office of Technology Innovation and Industry Relations (OTIIR)**.  

This was not a class assignment or project. I took this opportunity on the side to challenge myself and learn what it takes to build a startup from scratch.

## Why did I do this?
- To learn the fundamentals of creating a startup
- To work with a team to develop and refine a real business idea
- To gain hands-on experience in entrepreneurship
- To learn how to pitch a business, manage finances, and solve real-world problems

### Our Solution:
Big Bytes provides **pre-packaged, nutritionally balanced meals** using **locally sourced ingredients** and **eco-friendly packaging**, helping organizations minimize waste while serving healthy food.
